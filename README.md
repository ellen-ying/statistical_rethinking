# Learning Statistical Rethinking

This is a learning project of Statistical Rethinking (McElreath, 2020). The repository contains example codes from [the lecture](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN) and the book (McElreath, 2020), and my solutions to the practice problems and [weekly homework](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022).
